# Documentation Rules

- All documentation files (except README.md in the project root) must be placed in the `docs/` directory
- When creating new documentation, use descriptive filenames in `docs/` (e.g., `docs/feature_name.md`, `docs/module_name.md`)
- Module-specific README files should be moved to `docs/` with descriptive names (e.g., `lib/module/README.md` → `docs/module_name.md`)
- The root `README.md` should remain in the project root as the main project documentation

# Pull Request Rules

- When asked to create a pull request, always generate a diff with the main branch to create the pull request message/description
- The diff should show the changes between the current branch and the main branch to provide context for reviewers
